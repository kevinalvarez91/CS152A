2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_display/current_arrow_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_display/current_arrow_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell u_display/current_arrow_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_display/current_arrow_reg[1]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_display/current_arrow_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell u_display/current_arrow_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_display/next_arrow_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_display/next_arrow_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell u_display/next_arrow_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check
